Description: Given a set of Student's t distribution (that could come from
  outlier-robust fitting of data), this package computes a weighted mean
  from the given measurements. If the distributions overlap largely, then
  it is assumed that there is no significant error between the measurements.
  If the distributions do not overlap, then apparently there are other sources
  of variability that need to be taken into account.
